                        Some people may say Flareons are fire-type pokemons, but no, they are in fact, badass- type pokemons of the highest order.
                        You know how people say they haven't even reached their final form? Well 
                        this badass is in its final form. 
                        Allow me to expand on Flareon's badassery. 
                        Want a lighter? Flareon's got you. Want to BBQ? BAM hotman flareon's there. What if,
                        you want to be the very best, like NO ONE ELSE EVER WAS?? BAAAMM Broreon has. got. you. covered. And more importantly,
                        notice the fluffy boi, its very fluffy. Are you witnessing the epic fluff?? I'll explain the epicness through this
                        bar graph, as you can see, Flareon is at a 10/10 fluff, while the rest of the pleb normie pokemons are at a 1.
                        To all you naysayers out there, let me direct your attention to Episode PLACEHOLDER of the anime, where Flareon
                        F E C K I N  S H R E K T the opponent.
                        And now, let the testimonials show you the power of Flareon.
                        My life before flareon was sad and miserable, my coworkers talked behind my back, my husband never ate my cooking, even
                        my own children dared to talk back. But after I got a flareon, my coworkers fear for their lives, my husband raves about
                        my BBQ skills, and I threatened my children into silence. Thank you Flareon!
