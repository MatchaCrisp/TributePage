                <p class="main_txt">Record holder for most arrests made as a NYPD detective, Madeline
                    Wuntch quickly ascended through the ranks to Commissioner before her health no longer
                    permitted her to work.
                    Known for her decisive actions and incredible foresight, Ms. Wuntch lead the NYPD into
                    an era of explosive growth and community acceptance before quietly retiring to her
                    small cottage in Michigan due to her deteriorating health. 
                </p>
                <p class="main_txt">Ms. Wuntch was never married, nor had any children. Her personal life 
                    was intentionally kept quite private, except for her well-known friendship with NYPD
                    captain Raymond Holt. Captain Holt collaborated with Ms. Wuntch several times over her stellar 
                    career, eventually playing a major role in securing her the role of Commissioner.
